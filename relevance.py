NOTE: We've curated a set of query-document relevance scores for you to use in this part of the assignment. 
You can find 'relevance.csv', where the 'rel' column contains scores of the following relevance levels: 
1 (marginally relevant) and 2 (very relevant). When you calculate MAP, treat 1s and 2s are relevant documents. 
Treat search results from your ranking function that are not listed in the file as non-relevant. Thus, we have 
three relevance levels: 0 (non-relevant), 1 (marginally relevant), and 2 (very relevant).
